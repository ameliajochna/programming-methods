# Functional Programming Methods
This respository contains scripts in OCaml implemented for my Computer Science course "Functional Programming Methods" in University of Wroc≈Çaw.

Throughout the course I learnt practical aspects of emphasizing functional programming paradigms. I gained proficiency in recursion, data abstraction, type systems.

I build my own language for arithmetic expressions, using lexer, parser and evaluator division.

The key learning from the course was understanding how programming languages serve as formal tools for communication among people.
